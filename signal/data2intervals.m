%  of M vectors; each vector is assumed to reflect a different element such
%  as a neuron.  T is also a cell list of M vectors, and each value in T should
%  reflect the time of an observation in DATA.
%
%  INTERVALS should be a Nx2 matrix of time intervals, such as
%    INTERVALS = [ t11 t12; t21 t22; t31 t32 ; ...];
%
%  DATA_OUT is a cell list of size N x M.  Each element DATA_OUT{i,p}
%    contains all observations in DATA{p} that occured during the 
%    interval [interval(i,1) ... interval(i,2)].
%
%  T_OUT is a cell list of size N x M.  Each element T{i,p} contains the
%    time of all observation in DATA_OUT{i,p}.
