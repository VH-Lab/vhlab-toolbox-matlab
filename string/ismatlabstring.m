function tf = ismatlabstring(str, startiswithinstring)
% ISMATLABSTRING - is a character within a Matlab string?
%
% TF = ISMATLABSTRING(STR, [STARTISWITHINSTRING])
%
% Returns 0/1 for each character of STR as to whether or not the
% character is within a Matlab string literal. The quotes are considered
% to be part of the string.
%
% It is normally assumed that the beginning of STR is not already
% considered to be part of a Matlab string. The user can pass STARTISWITHINSTRING as
% 1 to indicate that the first character of STR should be taken to be within a Matlab
% string.
%
% Examples:
%    str = ['myvar=5; a = ''my string'';']
%    ismatlabstring(str)
%             000000000000011111111100
%
%    str = ['myvar=5; a = [''my '''' '' int2str(5) '' string'';]']
%    ismatlabstring(str)
