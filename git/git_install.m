% 'Install' is our term for forcing the local directory DIRNAME to match the
% remote REPOSITORY, either by cloning or pulling the latest changes. Any files
% in the local directory DIRNAME that don't match the remote REPOSITORY are deleted.
% 
% If DIRNAME does not exist, then the repository is cloned.
% If DIRNAME exists and has local changes, the directory is deleted and cloned fresh.
% If the DIRNAME exists and has no local changes, the directory is updated by
% pulling.
%
% Note: if you have any local changes, GIT_INSTALL will totally remove them.
%
% B is 1 if the operation is successful.
