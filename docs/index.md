## About

[vlt](http://vlt.vhlab.org) is a Matlab toolbox for general Matlab programming, science, and neuroscience. It includes the functions we wish Matlab had natively as well as
some lab-invented file formats. It has been slowly building since Steve was a grad student in 1999, with contributions from the lab and other colleagues (notably
Alexander Heimel, Mark Mazurek, and others) over the years.

The functions are available in two ways: as regular functions and in the package 'vlt'. The use of the functions without the `vlt.package.function_name` form is deprecated but they are still available.
