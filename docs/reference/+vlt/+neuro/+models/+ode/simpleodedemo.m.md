# vlt.neuro.models.ode.simpleodedemo

  SIMPLEODEDEMO - A simple demonstration of a first order, ordinary differential equation
 
   vlt.neuro.models.ode.simpleodedemo - Popups up a window that allows the user to watch
   the operation of a simple ode.  The equation simulated is the following:
 
   tau * d r(t)/dt = -(r(t)-C)+I
 
   The window has graphical user elements that allow the user to
   specify all of the parameters and to watch the simulation run.
