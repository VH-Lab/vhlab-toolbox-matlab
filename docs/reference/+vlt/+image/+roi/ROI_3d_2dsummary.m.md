# vlt.image.roi.ROI_3d_2dsummary

```
  ROI_3D_2DSUMMARY - return the 2d XY projection of 3d ROIs
 
  CC2 = ROI_3D_2DSUMMARY(CC3, IMAGESIZE)
 
  Given a set of index values that describe 3D ROIs (such as those returned 
  by BWCONNCOMP), this function returns the 2D projection of these
  ROIs onto the first 2 dimensions (X and Y).
