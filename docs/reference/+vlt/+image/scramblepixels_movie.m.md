  SCRAMBLEPIXELS_MOVIE - Scramble the pixels within a movie
 
 
   INDEXES = SCRAMBLEPIXELS_MOVIE(INFILE, OUTFILE)
 
   Scramble the pixels within a movie to illustrate the power
   of the mammalian visual system
  
   The INFILE is opened with the Matlab VIDEOREADER. A random permutation of
   the pixel indexes is determined and returned in INDEXES. The pixels in INFILE
   are shuffled by this permutation to create a new video OUTFILE.
