```
  CHI2UNIFORMTEST - Test for uniformity of distribution of data in bins
 
   [P,V,DF] = vlt.stats.chi2uniformtest(D)
 
   For data classified in discrete bins D(1), D(2), this returns the
   probability of the null hypothesis that the "true" number of data
   points in D(1) == D(2) == D(3) etc and that the observed differences are
   due to statistical sampling.
