# vlt.plot.autoplacetext

```
  AUTOPLACETEXT - Automatically place text within the current axes
 
   H = vlt.plot.autoplacetext(TEXTSTRING)
 
   At the present time, this function places the text string 
   TEXTSTRING (which can be a simple string, or a cell list of 
   strings) at the location 80% high, 50% centered, in the current
   axes.
 
   This function could be improved to examine the axes and 
   put the text in a "non-busy" location.
