# vlt.plot.hist2line

```
  HIST2LINE - generate a line plot from a histogram that will plot the histogram
 
   [X,Y] = vlt.plot.hist2line(BINS, COUNTS)
 
   Generates a line plot with values X, Y from the histogram with bin edges BINS and 
   bin counts COUNTS.  BINS should have one more entry than DATA, since DATA(i) is the number of points between
   BINS(i) and BINS(i+1).
