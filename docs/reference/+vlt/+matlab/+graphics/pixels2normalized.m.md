# vlt.matlab.graphics.pixels2normalized

```
  PIXELS2NORMALIZED - convert between pixels and normalized figure coordinates
 
  NEWRECT = vlt.matlab.graphics.pixels2normalized(FIG, RECT)
     or
  NEWRECT = vlt.matlab.graphics.pixels2normalized(FIG_RECT, RECT)
 
  Converts a rect in 'pixels' units to 'normalized' units (see 'help axes'
  for definition).
 
  This function obtains the figure rectangle from the figure handle FIG if the
  first input argument is a figure handle, or uses the rectangle FIG_RECT
  if it is a 4-element vector.
