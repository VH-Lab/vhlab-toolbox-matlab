# vlt.math.rot3d

  ROT3D - Rotation in 3d space
    R = vlt.math.rot3d(THETA, AXIS)
 
   Performs a 3d rotation about one of the 3-dimensional axes.
   If AXIS == 1, the rotation is performed about the X axis (dimension 1).
   If AXIS == 2, the rotation is performed about the Y axis (dimension 2).
   If AXIS == 3, the rotation is performed about the Z axis (dimension 3).
 
   Example 1:
