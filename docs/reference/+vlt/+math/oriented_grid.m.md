# vlt.math.oriented_grid

```
  vlt.math.oriented_grid Create an oriented sinwave on a grid
 
   ORI = vlt.math.oriented_grid(XSIZE, YSIZE, SPATIALPHASE, ORIENTATION, SPATIALFREQ)
 
   This will create an oriented sinwave grating pattern on
   a grid of size XSIZE x YSIZE with the given spatial phase
   SPATIALPHASE and orientation ORIENTATION (in degrees) with
   spatial frequency SPATIALFREQ.
