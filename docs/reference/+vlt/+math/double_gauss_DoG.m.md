# vlt.math.double_gauss_DoG

```
  DOUBLE_GAUSS_DOG - computes a double-gaussian function that is modulated
  by a difference of gaussians
 
  Z = vlt.math.double_gauss_DoG(THETA, SF, DOUBLE_GAUSS_PARAMS, DOG_PARAMS)
  
  THETA corresponds to angle
  SF corresponds to spatial frequency
  DOUBLE_GAUSS_PARAMS = [a b c d e]
  DOG_PARAMS = [0 a2 b2 c2 d2]
