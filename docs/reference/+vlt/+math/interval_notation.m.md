  INTERVAL_NOTATION - Description of interval notation in mathematics
 
  Interval notation is a means of expressing an interval as a pair of
  numbers. The numbers indicate the endpoints of the interval.
  Parentheses and/or brackets are used to show whether the endpoints are
  excluded in the interval, or are included.
 
  (N,M] is the interval from N to M, excluding N and including M
  (N,M) is the interval from N to M, excluding N and M
  [N,M] is the interval from N to M, including N and M
 
  Note that this is a mathematical notation (described for documentation
  purposes), and does not have meaning in Matlab code.  (That is, brackets and
  parentheses have different meanings in Matlab code.)
