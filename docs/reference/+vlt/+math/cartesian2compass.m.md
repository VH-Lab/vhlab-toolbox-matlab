# vlt.math.cartesian2compass

```
  CARTESIAN2COMPASS - Convert angles from cartiesian to compass
 
   C = vlt.math.cartesian2compass(R, USERADIANS)
   
   Converts angles from cartesian format to compass.
   In compass, 0 degrees is up, and angles rotate clockwise.
   In cartesian, 0 degrees is rightward, and angles rotate
   counterclockwise.
 
   If USERADIANS is 1, radians are used; otherwise, 
   degrees are used.
