# vlt.file.touch

```
  TOUCH - create a file (empty) if it does not already exist
 
  TOUCH(FILENAME)
 
  This function checks to see if FILENAME exists. If it does not
  exist, it creates a blank file and creates all necessary
  directories that may be required.
 
  If the file does not exist and cannot be created, an error is
  generated.
