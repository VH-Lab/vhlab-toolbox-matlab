# vlt.graph.dependency_graph

```
  DEPENDENCY_GRAPH - create a directed graph that describes dependencies among strings
 
  [NODES,G] = vlt.graph.dependency_graph(DEPENDENCY_STRUCT)
 
  Given a DEPENDENCY_STRUCT with fields 'name' (indicating the string name) and a structure named
  'dependencies' that has field names with other named strings, this function returns a set of nodes
   NODES with node names and a directed graph G indicating the dependencies.
