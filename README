This is the Van Hooser lab's general-purpose Matlab toolbox 

It has been developed by Steve Van Hooser and his collaborators (notably 
Alexander Heimel, Mark Mazurek, and others) over the years.

It is our intention that we only distribute code that we write or code that 
we have permission to redistribute. But this code has evolved since 1999, and it is
possible that something not meant for redistribution or something misattributed is present here.
If this is the case, please post an issue and it will be corrected.
