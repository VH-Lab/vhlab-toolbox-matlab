function [b,superclasses_inclusive] = isa_text(classname_a, classname_b)
% ISA_TEXT - examines whether a class is a subclass of another class type

% Returns B as true if CLASSNAME_A is equal to CLASSNAME_B or if CLASSNAME_B is 
% among the superclasses of CLASSNAME_A. SUPERCLASSES_INCLUSIVE is a cell array of

%
% Similar to ISA(A, CLASSNAME) except that both arguments are character strings instead
% of requiring one input to be an object.
