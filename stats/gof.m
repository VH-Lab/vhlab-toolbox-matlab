% GOF - Goodness of Fit from Zoccolan et al., 2005
%
%  [GF,Vres,Vexpl,Vnoise] = GOF(TRIALDATA, FIT)
%
% Returns goodness of fit that describes how much of the explainable
% variation (i.e., that not due to noise across trials) is explained
% by a given fit.
% 
% TRIALDATA should have M columns and N rows.  Each column should have
%   individual responses for one particular stimulus.  If any values are
%   NAN then these trials are excluded.
%
% FIT is a fit to the mean response to each stimulus and should be 1xN.
%
% GF is the goodness of fit measure from 0 to 1
% Vres is the residual variance left over from the fit
% Vexpl is the explainable variance
% Vnoise is the variance of the noise
