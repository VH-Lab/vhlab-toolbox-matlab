function mfi = medfilt_phase(img, nx, ny)
% MEDFILT_PHASE - perform median filter for phase of complex image
%
%  MFI = MEDFILT_PHASE(IMG, NX, NY)
%
%  Given a complex image IMG, this function performs a median filter with
%  width NX and NY that returns, for each pixel, the median phase. The median
%  phase is computed with CIRC_MEDIAN from the Circular Statistics Toolbox.
%
%  This function is not nearly as fast a traditional median filter.
