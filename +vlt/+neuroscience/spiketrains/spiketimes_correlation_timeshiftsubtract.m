%
%  Computes both the standard spike train correlation (XCORR_ACTUAL) between
%  TRAIN1 and TRAIN2, lists of spike times, using SPIKETIMES_CORRELATION, and
%  computes an estimate of the amount of this correlation that is due to slow
%  covarying spike rates with a time scale of SHIFT.
%
%  BINSIZE is the resolution (e.g., 0.002 for 2ms bins), and MAXLAG is the
%  maximum lag between the two trains TRAIN1 and TRAIN2 that will be computed.
%  (See help spiketimes_correlation)
%
%  The estimate of the amount of correlation that is due to slow covarying
%  spike rates is computed over TRIALS trials (e.g., 100), during which
%  each spike in the trains is time-shifted by a variable amount between 0 
%  and SHIFT (uniform distribution). SHIFT might be 0.100 to shift 100ms, 
%  for example.  This estimate is returned in XCORR_SHIFTED.  The percentile
%  distribution of XCORR_SHIFTED is returned in XCORR_PERCENTILE. Each Nth
%  row of XCORR_PERCENTILE is the N-1th percentile of the distribution.
