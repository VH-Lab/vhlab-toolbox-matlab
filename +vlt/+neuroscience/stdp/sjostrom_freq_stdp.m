function A = sjostrom_freq_stdp
% SJOSTROM_FREQ_STDP - Sjostrom's data on plasticity vs. spike rate and timing 
%
%   A = SJOSTROM_FREQ_STPD
%
%   Returns data from Sjostrom et al. 2001, showing how the change in
%   synaptic weight depends on frequency and timing.
% 
%   The data represent the synaptic change (in percent (I think)) as a function
%   of 60 repetitions of pairings of pre-synaptic and postsynaptic spikes.
%   
%   The first column of the table indicates the frequency used in the experiment.
%   The second column is the synaptic change when pre-before-post firing with a gap
%       of 10ms was used.
%   The third column is the standard error of the quantity in column 2.
%   The fourth column is the synaptic change when post-before-per firing with a gap
%       of 10ms was used.
%   The fifth column is the standard error of the quantity in column 4.
