function stim=stim1d_motion(x, t, spFreq, spPhase, Tf, dir)

% STIM1D_MOTION -- Creates a 1-D (space) motion stimulus for model computation
%
%   STIM=STIM1D_MOTION(X, T, SPFREQ, SPPHASE, TF, DIR)
%
%   Creates a discrete 1-D (in space) motion stimulus that can be fed to
%   a 1-d spatial model
% 
%       X should be a vector indicating the spatial positions to create, in degrees
%          (example: 0:0.1:10 creates 100 positions in increments of 0.1 degrees)
%       T should be the time values to compute (stim is assumed to be constant in each bin)
%          (example: 0:0.01:2 simulates 2 seconds in 0.01s steps, or a 100Hz monitor)
%       SPFREQ is the spatial frequency of the grating (say 0.1 cycles per degree)
%       SPPHASE is the spatial phase of the grating (between 0 and 2*pi)
%       TF is the temporal frequency (in Hz)
%       DIR is the direction (1 is left, -1 is right, 0 for no motion)
%
%    One can imagine that the units of the returned stimulus is brightness.
%
%    Each row of the returned stimulus represents the stimulus at 1 value
%    of time; time is represented across the columns.
%       
%    Example: stim = stim1d_motion([0:0.1:10],[0:0.01:2],0.1,0,4,1);

 % make the stimulus time set

[X,T] = meshgrid(x, t);  % make a mesh grid

stim = sin(dir*2*pi*Tf.*T+spPhase+2*pi*spFreq.*X);
