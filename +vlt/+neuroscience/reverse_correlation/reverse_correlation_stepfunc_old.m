function avgstim = reverse_correlation_stepfunc(spiketimes, kerneltimes, stimtimes, stim)

% REVERSE_CORRELATION_STEPFUNC - Performs RC between spike times and step function stimulus
%
% AVG_STIM = REVERSE_CORRELATION_STEPFUNC(SPIKETIMES, STIM_OFFSETS, STIMTIMES, STIM)
%
%   This function performs reverse correlation (AKA the spike triggered average, STA,
%   AKA the stimulus that was present (on average) at the time of a spike)
%   analysis between a series of spike times and a step function stimulus.
%
%   AVG_STIM is the stimulus that was present (on average) at the time of a spike
%
%       SPIKETIMES is the list of spike times
%       STIM_OFFSETS is a list of times relative to the spike at which to 
%                  compute the stimulus.
%	The stimulus is assumed to be a step function that assumes different
%       values at each step.  STIMTIMES is a list of the time of each step,
%       and STIM is a matrix of row vectors, where each row corresponds to 
%       one stimulus variable.
