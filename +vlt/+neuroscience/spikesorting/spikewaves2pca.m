%  Creates a set of "features" of the spike waveform WAVES by
%  calculating the values of the first N principle components.
%
%  Inputs:
%  WAVES: A NumSamples x NumChannels x NumSpikes list of spike
%   waveforms. 
%  N:  the number of principle components to include
%  Optional input:
%  RANGE: A 2 element vector with the START and STOP range to examine
%
%  Outputs:
%  FEATURES:   An N x NumSpikes list of features.
