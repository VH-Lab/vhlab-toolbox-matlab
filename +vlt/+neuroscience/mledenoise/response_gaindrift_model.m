%
%   This function assumes that the response to a neural spike train in response to stimuli
%   s_i can be written as
%
%   r(t) = g(t) * s_i(t)
%
%   where r(t) is the actual response observed as a function of time, g(t) is an unknown
%   slow background gain modulation of the cortex, and s_i(t) is the unknown mean response
%   to each stimulus.
%
%   This function computes the response to a specific model, where the stimuli are presented
%   in order STIMLIST at times STIM_TIMES and have stim duration STIM_DURATION. 
%   It is further assumed that SINPARAMS are parameters of a 4 sinusoidal fit to the data
%   that describes the slow drift in gain g. 
%
%   S_I_PARAMS is the mean response to stimulus type i, which can occur more than once in
%   the STIMLIST.
%
%   G_PARAMS is a 4 element vector that describes the weighting of the 4 sinusoids.  If 
%   G_PARAMS has a 5th element, it is assumed to be a constant offset for g(t).
%
%   R is returned at the STIM_TIMES.  If R is less than or equal to 0, R is set to eps.
