% SHIFTEDBAR - Shifted bar graph
%
%  HB = SHIFTEDBAR(BINS, DATA, SHFT, COL)
%
%  Draws a bar graph that is shifted from the X-axis by SHFT and using color
%  COL (a 1x3 RGB color).  If BINS and DATA have multiple rows, then
%  multiple graphs are drawn, and SHFT can be a vector giving the offset for
%  each graph and COL can be nx3, describing the color for each graph.
%  HB is the set of patch handles created during the drawing.
%
%  SHIFTEDBAR assumes one is plotting histogram data, so BINS should have one
%  more column than DATA, since DATA(i,j) is the number of points between
%  BINS(i,j) and BINS(i,j+1).
