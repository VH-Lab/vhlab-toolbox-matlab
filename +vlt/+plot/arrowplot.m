function h=arrowplot(x,y, theta, scale, varargin)
% ARROWPLOT - Make a plot of arrow shapes, like quiver
%
%  H=ARROWPLOT(X,Y,THETA,SCALE, ...)
%
%  Plots arrows at positions X and Y with directions
%  THETA (in DEGREES) and scale SCALE, according to the
%  properties below, which can be modified by providing
%  additional name/value pairs.  The arrow will be rotated to
%  point in THETA (in degrees, cartesian form, so
%  0 is rightward and angle proceeds counterclockwise).
%
%  The arrow length and arrowhead length will be scaled by
%  values in SCALE.
%
%  The name/value pairs that can be specified:
%  Property (default)       : Description
%  -------------------------------------------------------
%  length (1)               : Line length
%  linethickness (2)        : Line thickness
%  linecolor ([0 0 0])      : Line color (black by default)
%  headangle (30)           : Angle of arrowhead sweep back
%  headlength (0.5)         : Size of arrowhead length
%  
%  See also: DRAWSHAPE
