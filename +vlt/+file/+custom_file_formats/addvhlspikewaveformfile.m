%  ADDVHLSPIKEWAVEFORMFILE - Add waveforms to a VHL spike waveform file
%
%    ADDVHLSPIKEWAVEFORMFILE(FID_OR_FILENAME, WAVEFORMS)
%
%  Add waveform data to a VHL spike waveform file.
%
%  If an open FID (file identifier) is passed, then the data is 
%  written to that file.  Note that in this case no checking is
%  performed to make sure that waveform sizes correspond to what
%  is contained in the file's header, so make sure the waveform
%  sizes are accurate.
%
%  If instead a FILENAME is passed, then the function attempts to
%  open FILENAME and checks to make sure that WAVEFORMS matches
%  the header file parameters.
%
%  WAVEFORMS should be a matrix of size:
%       NUM_SAMPLES x NUM_CHANNELS X NUM_WAVEFORMS.
