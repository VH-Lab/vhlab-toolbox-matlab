% CHECKOUT_LOCK_FILE Try to establish control of a lock file
%
%  [FID,KEY] = vlt.file.checkout_lock_file(FILENAME)
%
%  This function tries to check out the file FILENAME so that different
%  programs do not perform some operation at the same time. This is a quick
%  and dirty semaphore implementation (see Wikipedia if unfamilar with 
%  semaphores). The LOCKFILE will also EXPIRE in 1 hour unless otherwise specified
%  below. A KEY is returned, which is necessary to pass to to vlt.file.release_lock_file.
%
%  This function tries to create an empty file called FILENAME. If the file is
%  NOT already present and the creation successful, the
%  file will be created and FID will return the file ID (see help fopen).
%
%  If instead the file already exists, the function will check
%  every 1 second for 30 iterations to see if the file disappears.
%  If the function is never able to create a new file because the 
%  old file exists, then the function will give up and return FID < 0.
%
%  
%
%  IMPORTANT: RESPONSIBLE CLEANUP: It is important that if the program that
%  calls vlt.file.checkout_lock_file is able to create the file (that is, FID>0),
%  then it should call vlt.file.release_lock_file to remove the lock file.
%  
%  IMPORANT: FILE CLOSURE: If 2 output arguments are given (that is, KEY is
%  examined), then the lock file is closed before vlt.file.checkout_lock_file exits.
%  If KEY is not requested in output, then the FID is left open for 
%  backwards compatibility.
%
%  Depricated release instructions (new code should not use): 
%  1) close the file with fclose(FID) and 2) delete the file
%  FILENAME that is created with delete(FILENAME).  If FID<0, then
%  it should NOT delete the file FILENAME because it is checked out by
%  some other program.
%
%  The function can be called with additional output arguments:
%  
%  [FID,KEY] = vlt.file.checkout_lock_file(FILENAME, CHECKLOOPS)
%
%  Alters the number of times the function will check (at 1 second
%  intervals) to see if FILENAME has disappeared.
%
%  [FID,KEY] = vlt.file.checkout_lock_file(FILENAME, CHECKLOOPS, THROWERROR)
%
%  If THROWERROR is 1, the function will return an error instead of
%  returning FID<0.
%
%  [FID,KEY] = vlt.file.checkout_lock_file(FILENAME, CHECKLOOPS, THROWERROR, EXPIRATION_SECONDS)
%
%  This mode allows one to specifically set the expiration time in seconds.
%  vlt.file.checkout_lock_file will examine the file for the expiration time and 
%  ignore and remove the lock file if it is "expired". By default, EXPIRATION_SECONDS
%  is 3600.
%
%  Example:
%     % I want to make sure only my program writes to myfile.txt.
%     % All of my programs that write to myfile.txt will "check out" the 
%     % file by creating myfile.txt-lock.
%     mylockfile = [userpath filesep 'myfile.txt-lock'];
%     [lockfid,key] = vlt.file.checkout_lock_file(mylockfile);
%     if lockfid>0,
%        % do something
%        vlt.file.release_lock_file(mylockfile,key);
%     else,
%        error(['Never got control of ' mylockfile '; it was busy.']);
%     end;
