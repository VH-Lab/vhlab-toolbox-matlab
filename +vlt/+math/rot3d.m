function r = rot3d(theta, ax)
% ROT3D - Rotation in 3d space
%   R = ROT3D(THETA, AXIS)
%
%  Performs a 3d rotation about one of the 3-dimensional axes.
%  If AXIS == 1, the rotation is performed about the X axis (dimension 1).
%  If AXIS == 2, the rotation is performed about the Y axis (dimension 2).
%  If AXIS == 3, the rotation is performed about the Z axis (dimension 3).
%
%  Example 1:
