% INTERVAL_NOTATION - Description of interval notation in mathematics
%
% Interval notation is a means of expressing an interval as a pair of
% numbers. The numbers indicate the endpoints of the interval.
% Parentheses and/or brackets are used to show whether the endpoints are
% excluded in the interval, or are included.
%
% (N,M] is the interval from N to M, excluding N and including M
% (N,M) is the interval from N to M, excluding N and M
% [N,M] is the interval from N to M, including N and M
%
% Note that this is a mathematical notation (described for documentation
% purposes), and does not have meaning in Matlab code.  (That is, brackets and
% parentheses have different meanings in Matlab code.)
