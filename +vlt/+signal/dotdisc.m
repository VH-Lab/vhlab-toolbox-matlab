function event_samples = dotdisc(data, dots);
%DOTDISC - Dot discriminator, an advanced window discriminator
%
%  EVENT_SAMPLES = DOTDISC(DATA, DOTS)
%
%  Detect events with "dots", a form of advanced window
%  discrimination.
%
%  DATA the data to be examined.
% 
%  DOTS - An N x 3 matrix with the "dots" to be used for the
%  discrimination. The first row is [ THRESH  SIGN 0] indicating
%  that all events larger than THRESH (in the direction of SIGN,
%  which can be 1 or -1) will be considered.  Each additional
%  row is [THRESH SIGN OFFSET], and only events that have a
%  signal of size THRESH (in the direction of SIGN) at the sample
%  location OFFSET relative to the highest/lowest point that
%  was determined in the first row will be selected.
%
%  EVENT_SAMPLES returns the sample numbers of events that 
%  are described by the DOTS. If more than one adjacent sample
%  passes the dot tests, then the sample number corresponds to
%  the point in the middle of the points that pass.
%
%  This is implemented as a mex function.
