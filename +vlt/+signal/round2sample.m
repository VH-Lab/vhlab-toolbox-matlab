function tr=round2sample(ti,dt,t0)
% ROUND2SAMPLE - Round a continuous point to the nearest sampled value for a regularly sampled signal
% 
%   TR = ROUND2SAMPLE(TI,DT[, T0])
%
%   Given a signal sampled at regular intervals DT, and given a set of time points TI,
%   calculates the closest sample times TR that are multiples of DT.
%   T0 is the time of the first sample. If it is not provided then it is assumed to be 0. 
%
%   Example:
%       DT = 0.001;
%       TI = 0.00100000001;
%       TR = ROUND2SAMPLE(TI, DT)   % returns 0.001

if nargin<3,

tr = t0+(point2samplelabel(ti,dt,t0)-1) * dt;
