% XCORR_STEPFUNC - Perform correlation between a step function and a step function
%
% [CORR,LAGS] = XCORR_STEPFUNCSTEPFUNC(TE, T1, SIGNAL1, MAXLAG, T2, SIGNAL2)
%
%  Computes the discrete approximation to the correlation
%   between an N step-function SIGNAL1 that changes values at times T1
%   and is at times T1, and the N step-function signal SIGNAL2,
%   which change values at times T2.  SIGNAL2 does not have to
%   have the same sample interval (sample rate) as SIGNAL1.
%   Note that values of SIGNAL1 and SIGNAL2 that are out of the range
%   are set to 0.
%
%   TE are the times over which to evalute the step functions, and
%   the time between successive values of TE is equal to 1 sample in the
%   returned cross-correlation.
%   
%   MAXLAG is the maximum lag to examine (in samples of TE). The XCORR
%   normalization is 'biased'.
%
%   The correlation is returned in CORR. It has 1 column per dimension of the
%   two step functions.
%
%   (Programmer note: there is a probably a better algorithm for this.)
