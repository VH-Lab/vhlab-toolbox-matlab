%  Returns a string that is a useful callback for uicontrols in graphical user interfaces.
%
%  This string performs the following actions:
%       1)  Obtains the name of a function, located in the figure's tag field (say, 'myfunction')
%       2)  Calls this function with input arguments 'command', TAG, 'fig', f, where f is the
%           number of the current figure, and TAG is the tag of the uicontrol that was clicked.
%
%  That is, this function calls myfunction('command',TAG,'fig',f)
