% SIMULATE_LME_DATA_SHUFFLED - (Helper) Generates data using the 'shuffle' method.
%
%   Methodology:
%   This is a non-parametric method that simulates data under the null
%   hypothesis by shuffling the model's residuals. It makes no assumption
%   about the shape of the error distribution, instead using the empirical
%   distribution of the errors observed in the data.
%
%   Process:
%   1.  Calculates the composite residuals from the baseline model (Residual =
%       Observed_Y - Grand_Mean). This residual combines the random effect
%       and the individual error term.
%   2.  Pools all residuals together and shuffles them randomly.
%   3.  Creates a simulated null dataset by adding the shuffled residuals back
%       to the grand mean. This breaks any relationship between predictors
%       and the outcome.
%   4.  Injects the `effect_size` to create the alternative hypothesis dataset.
%
%   Assumptions:
%   -   Assumes "exchangeability" of the composite residuals across the entire
%       dataset. This means it assumes any error could have occurred for any
%       observation, regardless of its group membership.
%
%   Pros/Cons:
%   +   Robust to violations of normality.
%   -   The exchangeability assumption is strong and often inappropriate for
%       mixed models, as it ignores the dependency within groups. This can
%       make it less accurate than the hierarchical method.
