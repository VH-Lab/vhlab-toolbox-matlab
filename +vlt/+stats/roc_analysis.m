% ROC_ANALYSIS - Receiver operating characteristics
%  [DISCRIM,PROB_TRUE_ACCEPT, PROB_FALSE_ACCEPT, XVALUES,...
%      CONFUSION,SAMPLE1CUM,SAMPLE2CUM]=ROC_ANALYSIS(SAMPLE1,SAMPLE2)
%
%  Performs ROC analysis to see how sensitivity and false positives trade
%  off if the task is to say which distribution a given value is likely
%  to have arisen from.
%
%  (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)
%  
%  For each value of X present in the samples SAMPLE1 and SAMPLE2, 
%  ROC returns the resulting probability of a "true accept" (we say
%  the value is from SAMPLE2 and it is) and the resulting
%  probability of a "false accept" (we say the sample is from SAMPLE2
%  but it's really from SAMPLE1).
%
%   Inputs:  SAMPLE1 - an array of sample data
%            SAMPLE2 - an array of sample data
%   Outputs: DISCRIM - Likelihood of discriminating the 2 distributions
%                      (accuracy) for each possible threshold X
%            TRUE_POSITIVE_RATE - The rate a true accept (sensitivity) (TP_x./(TP_x+FN_x))
%            FALSE_POSITIVE_RATE - The rate of a false accept (FP_x./(FP_x+TN_x))
%            XVALUES - The X-axis values for the cumulative density functions
%            CONFUSION - A structure with the "confusion matrix" assuming each value of
%                        X is used as a threshold. It has fields:
%                        confusion.TP_x: (true positive)
%				likelihood sample is X or greater and comes from sample 2
%                        confusion.FN_x: (false negative)
%				likelihood sample is less than X and comes from sample 2
%                        TN_X: (true negative)
%                               likelihood sample is less than X and comes from sample 1
%                        confusion.FP_x: (false positive)
%                               likelihood sample is X or greater and comes from sample 1
%            SAMPLE1CUM - The cumulative sums of SAMPLE1
