function answers = spreadsheet_multiplechoice(spreadsheet, question, varargin)
% SPREADSHEET_MULTIPLECHOICE - Return answers to a multiple choice spreadsheet question
%
% ANSWERS = SPREADSHEET_MULTIPLECHOICE(SPREADSHEET, QUESTION, ...)
%
% Returns a structure with responses to a multiple choice "question"
% in the header row of a spreadsheet. The header row is assumed to be the first
% row.
%
% The structure ANSWERS has 3 fields: question (the question asked), choices
% (a cell array of strings of the choices), and results (a vector of how many choices
% of each type were made).
%
% This function can also take name/value pairs that modify its behavior:
% Parameter (default)    | Description
% --------------------------------------------------------------------
% choices ([])           | If the user wishes to provide the choices, one
%                        |   can. This is useful for prescribing the order
%                        |   of the choices, or for indicating the possibility of
%                        |   choices that are not represented in the data. If empty,
%                        |   then choices will be determined empircally by the entries
%                        |   in the spreadsheet.
