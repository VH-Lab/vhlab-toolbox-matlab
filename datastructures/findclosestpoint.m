% Finds the index and value to the closest member of POINTLIST to POINT
% in Euclidean distance. POINTLIST should be a list of points, with 1 
% row per point. It returns the index in I and the value
% in POINTC.  If ARRAY is empointy, so are I and POINTC.
%
% If there are multiple occurances of POINT within POINTLIST,
% only the first is returned in I.
