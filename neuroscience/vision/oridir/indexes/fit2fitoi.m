%  OIIND = FIT2FITOI(R)
%
%    Calculates the orientation selectivity index (OSI) from a double gaussian fit
%    of a direction tuning curve.
%    The OSI is defined as OSI = (Rpref - Rorth) / Rpref
%    where Rpref is the average response to the preferred direction and the opposite
%    direction (that is, the preferred orientations), and Rorth is the average
%    response to the 2 directions orthogonal to the preferred direction (that is, the
%    orthogonal orientation..
%
%    R is a 2-row vector. The first row is the directions that were evaluated by the
%    fit (e.g., [0:359] is the most common for 1 degree steps between 0 and 359), and
%    the second row is the response of the fit for each angle.
