% CALC_CLUSTER_INDEX - Calculate cluster index from Ruthazer and Stryker
%
%   CI = CALC_CLUSTER_INDEX(CELL_PTS, ROI_PTS, SCALE, INJ_SIZE, WINDSIZE,
%           WINDSTEP, AREA_THRESH, FRACT_CELLS, [INDEXVALUES FUNC RANDFUNC])
%
%  Calculates the cluster index as described by Ruthazer and Stryker
%  JNeurosci 1996 16:7253-7269.
%
%  Computes the cluster index over a region of interest drawn tightly
%  around the data set excluding the injection site of size INJ_SIZE.  Square
%  windows of side size WINDSIZE are slid over the region of interest in
%  steps of WINDSTEP.  If the overlap of the window and the region of interest
%  is at least AREA_THRESH (a fraction of the total), then the cluster index
%  is computed in that window.
%  ROI_PTS and INJ_SIZE can be empty, in which case no points will be excluded,
%  the ROI will be taken to be a rectangle containing all points, the first
%  point in the cell list is assumed to be a cell and not the injection 
%  location.
%
%  The cluster index is computed by comparing nearest neighbor differences
%  of all cells in the data set to a random point.  Only FRACT_CELLS are used
%  in the calculation.  See the paper for a more complete description.
%
%  The cells are specified as a list of X-Y pairs.  It is assumed that the first
%  entry in the list is actually the injection location, not a cell.
%  The region of interest is also specified by a list of X-Y pairs that
%  define a polygon around the region of interest.  The points will be scaled
%  by SCALE, which indicates the number of point units per unit.
%
%  If the last three optional arguments are provided, then the cluster index is not 
%  computed based on physical distance between cells but rather the difference between
%  index values in INDEXVALUES, a vector w/ as many entries as there are cell points.
%  FUNC should be a string describing how to take the difference between x1 and x2,
%  INDEX values from two cells.  For example, 'min(abs([x1-x2;x1-x2-360;x1-x2+360]))'
%  or 'abs(x1-x2)'.  RANDFUNC is a function that describes how to randomly generate
%  an index value.  For example, RANDFUNC = 'rand*360' picks a value between 0 and
%  360 psuedorandomly.
